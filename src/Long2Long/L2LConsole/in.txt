 In event sourcing, replaying projections is a critical task that can help ensure the consistency and accuracy of your systemâ€™s read model. The process of replaying can be challenging, especially when streams get big, and you need to do it without causing any downtime. By the end of the talk, you will have a better understanding of the different strategies available and how to choose the one that best fits your requirements.
 
 Robert Baelde is a DDD and Event Sourcing enthusiast. During his career he introduced DDD concepts into the culture of multiple companies.

 Robert and We Are On The Mission to actually
 0:21
 improve peoples
 0:28
 Take You Back I think it's like a nice go and I Was A Was A quad developer dan
 0:35
 i used Orange I Wasn't Where of the main Different design or eventsing but I
 0:41
 Started a catch a spayment system project so The ID was to get Fish Those
 0:47
 of festival a rest band Within NFC chip en They could use that dress bank to pay
 0:52
 at the festival um en die system ehm was beeld quadride but officii right now
 0:59
 Every moments Ja eventually stip with Back in the Day I didn't really know that pattern Bird I new that tracibility
 1:07
 Would Be Quiet important for that system so I am the up using Kind of eventually
 1:14
 spellen basic Oh ja dat transaction Stable with all the um al die trasactions eh appending to it and
 1:21
 mutable so that work great and It workshire That couple festival Shoes dit
 1:27
 en Load on the System Goulding bigger en we hadden niet for dashboard so we build
 1:33
 a beautiful dashboard and was really Great But The quarries All ren on are
 1:38
 eventstream and When All on the Trace Action Stable en If you get a couple
 1:44
 Thousand uh koppel 100.000 of Events in that table The ensonily your day The bases kon ik zei Yeah I Don't really
 1:50
 like this en we hadden het happening during One Of The eh Production Events so during that Event we actually know
 1:57
 this That We should reskill A Day The Base en let me tell you That's not position you want to be in that It's
 2:03
 really off all to put your system Down to eskeled You're In The live Event so had ie een nieuwe about projections
 2:10
 Black Dance Dit moet Save Me a lot of stress diving tobjections en What are Those en
 2:18
 this Can't realia Events sourcing eh conference Without telling that well
 2:24
 projections a Simply a Fault last over je stream Right can it be
 2:30
 So if we uh metally Look at It We Could say or State is a mutation Of A previous
 2:38
 State and our new Event applied
 2:43
 so ifree took a really really really Simple example we have Event stream with
 2:49
 some Events on them So This Is tokens depos Dead token Spend
 2:55
 en tokens die Positive and if you know want to Keep track of the State Of The Balance Of Those Wallet Hoe Simply
 3:02
 Started First Event Replay that update of Balance Go over that and go for that
 3:08
 How what can it be so this All Works Fine But Now We find about an Assistant
 3:14
 en we Might need to Replay en boks are not Reason to Replay so
 3:20
 basically tree definitions The nightwired A Replay en the first Weasley
 3:26
 is een video Replay but it's a Just Play from the start en that is when you introduce a new projection So You have
 3:33
 this new feature coming up nu niet Tomorrow Way of Looking At data and you write you new Jackson and There
 3:40
 You put it Live you Play That and That's That's All so Kind of retable
 3:45
 Next To Dead is the most coming newscasector
 3:52
 so in thesecazes over Again and Replay op
 4:00
 de Third One is a better one out but
 4:06
 moments infu gdpr couple of years ago en That's All really Great for venture
 4:11
 Thing because now we have to deal with Throwing Away State Which Something We Don't We Like so There are some Technics
 4:18
 to actually remove this privacy sensitive information from your Events Tour um but when you remove It For Your
 4:24
 Events Tour You also Need To Make sure dat je op projections don't containing that privacy sensitive information One
 4:30
 Technique could be to actually Replay op adejector after of move that Sens verdela som order techniekspert We wonen
 4:36
 diving to that zo bijvoorbeeld we need to keep on Mind When We ride op
 4:45
 projections and the first Ground rule is that projections should Always Give the
 4:50
 same Out Come So if you Throw way to State throw a State and we Play oprojector
 4:56
 Same So This means no use of incemental ideas in your retables No automatically
 5:04
 generated you are the Something randomly generated ideas en previous Job I work
 5:10
 that was a Thin that Company The actually dinner new about this road of projector for Area team en de dedentable
 5:18
 headlike in Commando ideas En de date Team umiddel Wasn't a wear that Those
 5:23
 ideas could Change for the road so They use Them To reference of Rose to make make me even Big makes manual fixes
 5:30
 en you can Legend that Iran really happy when we Replay that projector and all There ideas wear and matching up with
 5:36
 the roast The expected to matchup bit so Keep than The Mind Love someone's that
 5:41
 you can't really make Request to external Systems ehm from your projector or even be Quest to other State That's
 5:48
 not in your Events theme so Keep Your Scope ofte of de projector olie de eh
 5:54
 State of Events Don't make Annie outside Cause Because you can't really guarantee de doos calls will give to Same result
 6:00
 when you Replay your projector en second Real we need to have is that
 6:06
 project doesn't have Side Effects is not a projector anymore It's
 6:11
 a reactor It's reacts to your Events stream and call this song order stuffing your system to Weapon so that can be
 6:17
 States Change It can be Sending emails Or What can be trying creditcards en you
 6:23
 can a Megen What happens if you have you listen to your eh Order of confirmed
 6:29
 eventueel need to Charger en dat wins heppelin now you Replay that
 6:35
 uh that for Civic Consumer You are you Start to charge your Customer Twice and
 6:40
 That's really good for business like you have a lot of review coming in That's Until your customer's XD Attack
 6:46
 that you've Charge Time multiple Times And then You're business will be really be met
 6:53
 Soul replaying eh projectors There are weesley eh two Big teams and There to
 6:59
 That For You need to take a Take Count off First of all is the Replay Time ehm
 7:04
 als je eventstream gets bigger and bigger you read They Time I Will and queens so There Was some strateges We
 7:10
 Can We Can into use tractionally keep that Replay Time To an accept to a level of wie vindt make the Replay Time eh
 7:17
 solo that you can excely Replay that Without anyone Nothing
 7:25
 Replay eh your projectors so Let's Life into this week Time
 7:31
 en we can say that the det Total Replay time is the amount of Events we need to
 7:39
 Replay Times The Average Time it takes per Event Replay Simple Right en we
 7:46
 connectionally do something on Boat Side Of The ugression to reduce to Total Ready Play Time
 7:52
 so Let's Dive in How can we actually we doos The Number of Events of we need to Replay en The First One is really Simple
 7:59
 One Just filled route we don't need so fioli Need Quinn Events then we Let The
 8:05
 Green Event True and do I fans we don't need Them so Just well them and doesn't
 8:10
 even seed The protector Anyway That's the most simple thing We Can Do en probably using that because you are
 8:16
 Select Events you Replay Next One is partitioning So
 8:21
 if you look at all the Events your system that Grand be really really many like eh koppel 1000 Maybe Million Events
 8:28
 There is really Big Systems that have really really a Lord of Events So if you have projector that uh listen to Wall
 8:35
 The Events and need to repl the Events we kunnen Legend att takes eh quaid of time If You Knows kopen done and look at
 8:42
 the Events for one specific account type Het het is not so many anymore and Every
 8:48
 For The First kopen Down
 8:59
 most optimum Scope to actually eh Play Jackson on So if you can do that You're
 9:05
 Goulding so let's take Look at the Balance projector So This Is When You
 9:10
 When you listen to the old stream with all Events in objector and we know need to Replay It Any Take the lord of time
 9:16
 Before are projection Next has handled all the Events of all wallets but As you
 9:22
 can see in this projectory Only calculator Balance of a specific Wallet so we can put Those Events Side to Side
 9:30
 spin op zijn More containers som more processies and Just perhedel Execute
 9:35
 Those er is per Jacksons bel je Might say well it's Alphen and
 9:41
 all but How Often ehm is it actually that you are projection oftenis live One
 9:46
 specific uh agregate root ID that you can also potion on Different Different
 9:53
 poppies zo in this case we want to have the Total Balance of een specific festival We were net we can Just potion
 10:00
 based on the festival key of the Wallet zo is dat of Spitting up By acroboot
 10:06
 type you can Crew A Down By other properties en this Look the Simple is implantation
 10:13
 of this potioning Looks Like This we have are Events Them on the left Them we have Some Kind of potion function en het
 10:19
 protection function will your Events to the difference en wie
 10:27
 niet to play Secure because otherwise It will Just need to wait for all the traditions to get shop en we hebben
 10:32
 She's Anything And Now All Our process can happely consumar Events impero
 10:40
 we can Take This one stephoto What If is that of Pushing Those potions to acue
 10:46
 That's get emptypal Jackson what if the actually push Them To a new Events theme
 10:52
 but doing This we can actually Replay specific Partition of our eventstream
 10:58
 sowie don't have to Replay all the all the Events of all Different Streams When
 11:03
 It Was A burk and Ones Pacific potion or we Good even do a rolling update so o
 11:09
 Rolling repair So This Means That We have a process or multiple processies that Just One By One potion by potion
 11:15
 Handle dplay en sinds veel potion is small en Off The Replay of a one potion
 11:23
 doesn't take that much Time soja's die can do that Without warning too much
 11:34
 basically we have a partitioner wil Just Simply Return The Partition Key And then
 11:40
 we apply that to or projector And Only Thing we need to take into account With
 11:46
 or writing of projector is that we need to the able to reset the State voor specific Partition So you can see that
 11:53
 Why Here In This case we Partition by the Wallet ID and We Just reset The Balance of That's becific Wallet
 12:00
 and Next tracker use is introducing dom manevanse so oftenly in your in your
 12:07
 internal Event stream your Events are quite uh gradular zo ehm uef for
 12:14
 eksempel ehm you have user name set en you Might have user email updated I'm
 12:21
 but Maybe You're Consumer is Only ehm really Careyn about validated users zo Deze is al omboording en user and Alive
 12:28
 nation so connectie listen to waldo's Events in a reactor en nou When I Use of
 12:35
 validated or verified Events XD Arizona stream and internal stream you can
 12:42
 combine Those Events into a Public Event mod payload en is More specified For Our
 12:48
 Consumer you can pub AZ to a Public stream where are consumers and other
 12:53
 Systems can listen to implementingsdat je eh reactor is actually quite Doble You just need to
 13:01
 Keep eh some State Of Your eh Events The happen and onesie verified Event you retard
 13:08
 State Back buildout your Big Event Dit zijn dat voor your Public stream en en
 13:14
 to The Stream simular pattern to this is use of
 13:20
 transitional Events en dispat en really safeed safetor ehm Alive Swen Services
 13:27
 we we had policy that actually ehm would have All Different garn of properties
 13:33
 and Everytime of One Of The Spot These with Change when Eat it to calculator Premium Again en die is al impotation of
 13:39
 This Was That are projective with actually calculator Premium as well and
 13:45
 the Premium Wood and be storing Har Event Store ehm en als je kunnen magen ehm calcleding bij Premium in objective
 13:52
 was really really not the right Joyce mertweek and introduce 2017
 14:11
 de connectionally Have A New Balance updated Event en nou op Balance
 14:16
 projector Only need to Car About The Last devent en Those communited in the
 14:22
 same commit zo aggregat need to adjust for this but if you have a lot of calculations It can we prevent ehm your
 14:30
 productions to do a Lord of calculations adjust carrobout some Final Event
 14:36
 als we dus die die Logic en The defend Number of Events are uh reaction has to handle
 14:42
 last Technique to reduce the Number of Events hoe je after Replay is is cute's nepsalding en snapshoting eh Can We used
 14:51
 Parents in soulscases we hadden het Isn't ehm It Isn't discussion for for all things Because if you have a broken
 14:57
 projector And that work also be your Snapshot State dan It doesn't work but
 15:02
 actually escuador for Great bettan zou het snapeling we Take are State a
 15:08
 specific off set en a stream en descase het al voor Events ehm we We Know That
 15:14
 are Balance is 8 nou It's a replaying the hole stream We Just say Okay we
 15:20
 start From The Last known chapshot beloot het Snapshot into A State now we
 15:25
 Replay All Lost VI Events en want emphicized that is Big
 15:30
 difference between Snapchat and Snapchat
 15:47
 so in banging for example ehm you have this concept of a book Year Of The End
 15:54
 Of The Year you close of stream you start a new one en most domains have
 15:59
 searched Kind of concept actually Wood Keep Your stream eh short We hebben het
 16:04
 projections You Don't Own The Stream you conceum en projection ofte die is een aggregation of Different stream even zo
 16:12
 with productions this argument doesn't really Hold stands Next To Dead if you want to Into the
 16:18
 snapshoting Ago get Woods We Know of to deal with cerealisation of all aggregate
 16:23
 Wood State and You also have to dfzere Lizet en this at quartzone accident complexie
 16:29
 Where with persians We All By The know how to process Estate because That's the whole purpose of a perception So This Is
 16:36
 Just small Infra structure consern naam en Lassie remove een Snapshot in een
 16:43
 neckwick
 16:49
 The Snapshot Again en hydrated so Again Lot of annoys with havinghs
 16:57
 projections you can Simply Replay in the background Creature Snapshot and Being
 17:03
 Moving en de big fingers I gots decisions and projections are about
 17:09
 State So This Is Why snap shilling really helps with your directions en
 17:14
 should diavoide en Only ablight Evert if you really can't Do Anything Else
 17:22
 So This concludes die number of Events ehm That We have to Replay en nou let's
 17:28
 take a look at the Average Time at takes per Event to appliet eh in objection so ff some projector detection doesn't
 17:35
 esquel statements or statements to store Every Event That We Replay remake a ride
 17:45
 to a disc en descam work is your Events stream
 17:54
 of Events you need to be play my take a look attackly batching Those update into One specific
 18:02
 update zo even instead Weed the State at the begin alfabeth apply It A memory
 18:09
 Ride tv zult two Our State It's save a lot of a Yo traffic en that's of dan
 18:15
 hier de Most costly Part Of Your Replay en doing This is quite quad Easy ehm Def
 18:23
 this uh this projector we uh say OkÃ© we start The process eh a badge we need to
 18:30
 Load to State for all the eh The Events That We Are Going To process in the spect Wie loopt dat in memory Now Handle The
 18:38
 Events det Die in the badge en after that he Just commith the badge to the State Again
 18:47
 um en This is one of the olie things Rex Again do to We Do stereo The Replay Time um all the Order of quite complicated
 18:54
 vast niet zo Let's Which over to
 19:01
 infrastructure slide
 19:18
 update Event en new version of that user update Event Comes Along en hij is
 19:24
 Change My name If I message The Other and I First apply the new Event in after
 19:30
 that i play The Original One then My username will be Wrong The projected
 19:35
 because the ride on Would Be overwating by the old one So You Order of the Events That We Handle object uh metassa
 19:41
 Lot Next To Dead we need to try to do exactly Ones processing of Events
 19:48
 you can a matchen If You update your Balance en je actie die doet ook calculation in Yoko Zoomer If You Handle
 19:55
 that Event Twice you ever Wrong eh Wrong Balance
 20:01
 And The Third One is Who be great If you can Replay Without Every downtime to Assistant So This Means That are State
 20:09
 that up in produces actually Is Always available for r-reach en dat we iets
 20:15
 Still can exact Rides to Our system zo Ik vind dat jullie I go to implement
 20:24
 store en upoetzee okÃ© There are Event Store Just
 20:29
 Simply pushi Events two uprojectors Never Jack was Handle Them One By One
 20:37
 and Michael Great no What happens if it anding of one
 20:45
 Event Fails and this All The Same process so we Pushing
 20:51
 for Zombie is een project e throws and Exception en nou die opproses Cats to Ahold en ehm
 20:58
 even een flexing b doesn't get Event So This is of Just need something that
 21:03
 we don't want we want Them To Be ehm to be separate so Let's Inter dews aque
 21:08
 before projectors and now We wish are Events To The Kill
 21:15
 en oprede Simply Handle all the Defence and Kiel en we can useamps like the
 21:20
 outbox better than to actually Make surded an Event is XD communited to the cue
 21:25
 en Now objections Handle it and everything is fine but let's take a look at How A Replay
 21:33
 for this work so I have One projector That's Happy
 21:39
 Life and I want to Replay at Without any time so We Are The copy o clone of That
 21:45
 projection a Long Side en we know thatch all the Events on the
 21:50
 Events in the Events theme That We want Jack and play the same Time Tell are Event Store OkÃ©
 21:58
 nou discu als ze niets to receive R new Events
 22:03
 Now Events Can objections can Handle The Events en weer al done and now If Our leg in
 22:12
 our Replay projection sketching up with the lag in our original Production weekend over
 22:18
 en is Looks kwijt doorball eh If You Look at it on slides but This is really
 22:24
 on Nightmare twentlement en I've Been Here I Had A Legacy system that uses this guy of projections en making shirt
 22:32
 that you don't makes Any Event with the sweb over ehm is really on Nightmare and this brings is actually to Wong Big
 22:39
 Floor in this Kind of infrash tractor is that Up projections shouldn't Be A
 22:44
 concern Of The Event Store should be about storing R Events about
 22:52
 system
 23:00
 for reading The Events but it schulden be about projections it shouldn't Know actually What A Jackson is That's All
 23:06
 weight Side Problem and not Something are Event Story should be concert with So if you turn on the round objections
 23:14
 shoot actually B autonomus en How It That look like so we have Our
 23:21
 Event Store we have Some Kind of code teas of code that actually Keeps
 23:28
 track of the offset To The Stream of War Event Store en we hebben projection
 23:33
 zo weinig restarten die offset of Zero The Ask al Event Store HÃ© doe je F1
 23:39
 sinds Event Zero en al eventueel My say Yep I've got One hands It overtoo are a
 23:47
 projection manager in the Production manager wil of Light That Event to rusje
 24:00
 The offset die Checkpoint To The Stream
 24:06
 gets Some Kind of update Signal Event Or What is my be even some loop
 24:15
 en als okÃ© give me al die Events sinds The Last knone offset that I've got
 24:22
 and Event Store happier complicas The Event up projection manager applies The
 24:28
 Event To The Jackson and this codes over and overwinovo Can
 24:33
 SO disgustis som adventages First of all the Inter deals single responsorbility
 24:40
 of One spongebility For The Event store on the right Side en we have a posjections responsible for the beat
 24:47
 Side is is really die koppel Because We have Simple Interface With Our Event Store
 24:52
 and That's All we have this also Give some really Great
 24:59
 adventages for parallel processing of objections en al uh Dive into that More In The Next
 25:06
 Three slides en zijn bonus we got instant Inside in
 25:11
 the helft of our protections because we see the offset they have to the Events Dream so we can Simply see the Delta to
 25:18
 the to the All stream To The Stream The listen to American calculate How Good up
 25:24
 rexion is exclip performance so let's take a look at How potions with
 25:29
 Good like with disgun of interstructure so ever Events on the left and are
 25:35
 Events door Now ehm guessr Event to the Partition function in Returns de
 25:41
 Partition Key en Twice to find State de offset voordat specific potion Key this
 25:48
 Gates twind no are Production manager NOS that it needs to Handle and New Event
 25:55
 en It Goes Going To asks The Event Store OkÃ© Give Me All Events sinds The Last
 26:00
 devented I handled so not Simply eh taking that Event From The Event Store It Goes by Its Own States en Ask die
 26:08
 venster gay Give Me All Events since this stated I Know and all Event Store wil Give that Event
 26:15
 to the projection manager en het wil appliet two Our projector
 26:22
 nou If We have some Event at we don't know the State of
 26:27
 Just create the new off set with Zero and Jackson
 26:36
 en eventueel Give the Events en Opel Jackson
 26:45
 manager is is extreme not that complex So if we Take A per section Idea Bridge
 26:53
 contains die Partition Key we can Simply say Okay get the Checkpoint form AV
 26:59
 postery or Return The initial Checkpoint If We have don't have Any and lock this
 27:04
 Pacific potion so that no order parad process with actually try to update the
 27:10
 same eh Same projection Next To Dead We Get The Events Change The Last
 27:16
 Checkpoint formal Event Store rehandle Them in oxaction en dit is dus
 27:24
 nog die code because UMC newfound some error handling Here and We calculate the
 27:29
 Checkpoint what for What your Lost hÃ¤ndelt Event was en nou precies de Checkpoint eh two are
 27:37
 uh Ida base en heb die computer
 27:44
 zijn voor structure Replay eh become really really simple so we have this projector that hendel of
 27:52
 Events I we want to Replay It we Simply Put A projector Next To It and empty
 28:00
 Estate and set die offset to Zero Now Apple
 28:06
 event Store okÃ© give me the Events in Zero rehandle The Events and if you see that
 28:13
 the offset from R original projector is marriing or are Replay projector is
 28:20
 nearbying the offset uh From Up projection manager en even That's bed in een label Delta de reactie die kent
 28:27
 Switch over eh from are Original One to retaway 1
 28:33
 So This also interiorses ehm orgasis flexibelity to use snapchating Without
 28:38
 Too Much hasle Because if you have Snapchat you Simple can put
 28:44
 The protection alongside It zet die offset to the offset dat hij
 28:49
 Snapshot was tekening net en dan Our projection manager Simply
 28:54
 fetch The Best Of The Events en After The Storm
 29:04
 to Lost section and That's actually How can do projections in de background
 29:10
 Because The Lights are a nice but having this her introduous this song complexibility so connection die doe dat
 29:17
 eh on the fuel Different levels in Assen kunnen we dat in the lowest level by making a projections Action die aware
 29:24
 that they are Replay or weekend
 29:29
 deployment with Different eh application release So if you have a projections aware that
 29:37
 you are be played we can Simply Tell that to use tomorr eh data eh dedestore
 29:43
 denk ik in die onder table It can be Another instants Of The Day The Base Running som Wells met samplee When The
 29:50
 projection is Replay in Replay mode rewrite we Different Store
 29:55
 And then Wants me uh want to Bring That Production live we swap-out die ehm de
 30:03
 de store areal usage or We Do a re name of the table and are new projection is
 30:09
 live Wat is het quite Messi in code because now or projection need to know about
 30:17
 Replay It need to know about are Different For possi imprementations so
 30:24
 in Here we see that we need to get some reposity and this can Just Be The possi
 30:29
 injected en nou we need to eh check bij RB playing ifs than we need to tell a
 30:38
 repossary that nest to use of specific table for Replay en heeft Not There we
 30:43
 can use regionline Temptation en This is quite som accidentle complex City To
 30:49
 Have Yours Jackson ehm so Only use this If You ehm need to repair op exactions
 30:55
 automatically en your system ehm en You don't have Any other Way of doing it
 31:00
 in alstublieft Play Office tv put up Replay Live And tell a that it
 31:06
 Need To switch The Reach van de Different 1
 31:11
 zo een Next tragy and use is to Just inplant een new version offer projection So This is great Of You ehm add some
 31:20
 data to in 16 projector ehm en Happy lift Next
 31:34
 too and We don't even to worry about the old implementation al wel The Old
 31:41
 features that used to original inputation The Sims you can bring version 2 Live Without actually Heaven
 31:47
 The feature toggle Dawn we can dan Replay It or start The projection en
 31:53
 onesie vinkets It's It's Life on off you can talk Alone The feature ehm we can actually Quality ehm move are
 32:02
 used formul Original One to the version Two One And at the End of the day ehm we
 32:08
 can Sunset The Original One last Lee ehm we can do a blue Green
 32:14
 deployment Where we read from som Event Store moet je even application deploit
 32:19
 en If you know want to bring a new version uh version live
 32:25
 recently ehm put One Live It in niet zo stage over
 32:31
 het Action niet meer nodig en die States and We Just Talent to Kate Let's Replay Everything en one for up we can actually
 32:37
 Boots Are version 2 live dat This is quite complex if you need to
 32:44
 repair Everything en you Mighty Want To Be selective of what you Replay and use
 32:50
